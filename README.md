# Installation
### Requirements
- Houdini 18.5

### RELEASE ARCHIVE HAS A DIFFERENT FOLDER STRUCTURE THAN THE REPO
This is to allow for convenient developing if you are worknig with git, but also easy installation for users.

### Easy method:
Download a release archive, and extract the contents to your user Houdini folder or Site Houdini Install Directory

## Custom Install Location
If you are extracting the contests somewhere else on disk you will need to modify the ChoreoFX.json and place that into a package folder as described here:
https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/plugins.html

Modify the "HOUDINI_PATH" value to point to ChoreoFX/houdini if you are cloning the repo or ChoreoFX if you have downloaded the archive

# Updating
Remove the entire ChoreoFX folder and then extract to the same location with the new release.
